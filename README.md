## Hi there 👋

it is IT user

天空灰得像哭过

离开你以后 并没有 更自由

酸酸的空气 嗅出我们的距离

一幕锥心的结局

像呼吸般无法停息

抽屉泛黄的日记

榨干了回忆那笑容

是夏季

The sky is as grey as crying

It's not any freer to be away from you

The sour air smelled our distance

A poignant ending to a scene

I can't stop breathing

The diary in the drawer yellowed

Drained the memory of that smile

It is summer.
